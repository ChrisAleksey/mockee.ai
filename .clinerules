[LEARNING_JOURNAL]

- Regularly updating {memory_dir} and any instruction files help me to remember what I have done and what still needs to be done so I don't lose track.
- Ensure functions handle potential `None` inputs gracefully to prevent TypeErrors.
- Verify function call arguments match definitions precisely after refactoring.
- `analyze-project` implicitly handles key regeneration and tracker updates.
- Large context windows can cause `write_to_file` to truncate; prefer `apply_diff` for targeted changes.
- Verify data structures passed between functions (e.g., list vs. dict vs. float) when debugging TypeErrors.
- Check file writing logic carefully (overwrite vs. append vs. reconstruction in buffer) when investigating duplication bugs in tracker files. Ensure write mode ('w') fully overwrites.
- Carefully respect the ground truth definitions for dependency characters when adding/changing dependencies.
- When using `apply_diff`, the SEARCH block must match the current file content exactly, without any +/- markers from previous diff attempts. Use `read_file` to confirm content if unsure.
